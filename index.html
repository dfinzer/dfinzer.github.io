                    <b>The Problem With Solving Your Own Problems</b>
                    <hr/>
                    <p>
                    One of the most common mantras of Silicon Valley is "solve your own problems." The idea is that 1) being as close as possible to your problem helps, and 2) you should start with the problem, not the solution.
                    </p>
                    <img src="https://i.chzbgr.com/maxW500/5545445888/hC2071FE2/"/>
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    <p>
                    These are both good guidelines.
                    </p>
                    <br/>
                    <p>
                    At a macro level, however, following this advice results in the solving of only a very small subset of interesting problems—namely, those faced by people who have the opportunity and capacity to "solve their own problems". It leaves little room for cross-disciplinary thinking and fosters what we see today in the Silicon Valley startup world: a multitude of startups solving the same first world problems.
                    </p>
                    <br/>
                    <p>
                    A better mantra might be: get close to a problem in the world and solve it.
                    </p>

                    <hr/>
                    My latest project is to optimize my mornings. The time from the moment I get out of bed to the moment I head out on my bike to work is around 15 to 20 minutes. Based on conversations with friends, this is already a pretty short amount of time. Therefore, my goal is not necessarily to shorten the time I spend getting ready, but rather to make efficient use of that time to ensure that I start my day off on the right foot.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    My first observation is that there are certain things I'd like to know every day. These include:<br/>
                    <br/>
                    - What are the major headlines of the day?<br/>
                    - How are my finances doing? What are the prices of certain stocks I care about?<br/>
                    - What are some important habits I should focus on? (eye contact, enunciation, etc.)<br/>
                    - What's a new vocabulary word I could employ?<br/>
                    <br/>
                    I suppose such information could be put in a daily email. But it seems more fun, more interactive, more efficient, and perhaps more ingraining to put these reminders in a "daily wakeup assistant". So I have decided to build this. While I'm walking around my room getting ready, my macbook will display and read off a bunch of relevant information pertaining to the above questions (and other topics).<br/>
                    <br/>
                    Ideally, this will be interactive through a voice interface. If I wish to delve deeper into a news article for example, I might request that my assistant read me the full text of the article. Finally, it would be cool if I could incorporate some basic intelligence and learning into the project—having the presenter include extra details on particular information based on my patterns of interaction. Who knows if I'll get around to that.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    So far, the project has involved  fiddling with AppleScript, voice recognition software, a bunch of API's, scheduling software. Not sure if I'll release anything to the general public, but stay tuned.

                    She spoke to me<br/>
                    In a wild tongue<br/>

                    “How do you do?”<br/>
                    “How do I do.”<br/>
                    The sun lit a match<br/>
                    And dropped it on the earth<br/>
                    Through madness<br/>
                    Down<br/>
                    Down<br/>

                    as clay<br/>
                    into the shape<br/>
                    of somebody.<br/>
                    two bodies tangled,<br/>
                    their worlds<br/>
                    melting together<br/>
                    and her<br/>
                    clinging to him,<br/>
                    a body afraid<br/>
                    to fall to its knees<br/>
                    again.<br/>

                    she held on to something deep<br/>
                    and placed it somewhere dark<br/>
                    fed it<br/>
                    felt its fur<br/>
                    stick to her<br/>
                    sweaty hands<br/>
                    it was alive only for<br/>
                    her and<br/>
                    she watched its gray<br/>
                    shape pass<br/>
                    through the<br/>
                    tunnels in her mind<br/>
                    it was nothing she could<br/>
                    place a finger on it<br/>
                    was something much<br/>
                    colder<br/>
                    than she had imagined<br/>
